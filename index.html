  <title>WOTUS Topic Analysis</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>WOTUS Public Comments Topic Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Analyzing Topics with Latent Dirichlet Allocation</h2>

    <p> The following topics were generated using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model in Scikit-Learn on the entire training set. LDA is a statistical model to find the different mix of <code>n</code> topics that comprise the comments in the collection. The user needs to supply the number of topics, which isn't always clear in an un-labeled dataset. Fortunately there's a <code>perplexity</code> metric, which allows you to compare models using a varying <code>n</code> number of topics to help determine the appropriate topic count for the dataset.</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity">Wikipedia</a> defines <code>perplexity</code> as:</p>

    <blockquote>In information theory, <bold>perplexity</bold> is a measurement of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample. It may be used to compare probability models. A low perplexity indicates the probability distribution is good at predicting the sample.</blockquote>

    <p>Since perplexity will continue to drop as the number of topics increases, one way to determine an appropriate topic count is to look for the "elbow" in a chart of scores by topic.</p>

    <p>
      <img src="./Figures/LDA_Perplexity_for_nTopics.png">
    </p>

    <p>In the above chart, the sharpest decline in perplexity happens from two to eight topics, with a flattening of the curve thereafter. The chart indicates that around eight topics is where the law of diminishing returns kicks in thus further improvements to perplexity are minimal. The model was set to eight topics, which were then qualitatively analyzed to further garner insight into the dataset.</p>

  <h2>LDA Topic Summary</h2>

  <p>
    The comments in the dataset tend to share a lot of language, so the most frequent words extend across many of the topics. This makes it hard to distinguish the topics with top words alone.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, reviewing exemplary comments per topic and adjusting the values for lambda with the relevance metric slider (in the right-hand chart) helped to identify the general theme for a selected topic. Below is a summary of the key words and themes per topic:
  </p>

  <div class="list_container">
    <ol>
      <li>
        These comments make general requests to protect headwaters, intermittent and ephemeral streams, and waterways. They use science-based arguments that relate to definitions and exclusions in the rule change, like navigable waters, groundwater, surface water, and the connectedness of the water system in general. They also argue for wildlife and habitat
      </li>
      <li>
        This topic leans more politically than others while making similar points about using the latest science to protect waterways as the first topic. It also references specific regions, like the South and West, that would be left vulnerable. There are requests to reconsider the "risky" proposal, and notes that the CWA is a bipartisan success story and should remain intact
      </li>
      <li>
        This topic is a catch-all for supporters of the rule change. There are comments from farmers and ranchers who want "clean water and clear (or common-sense) rules" and landowners pushing for property rights. These are people who mention they are using responsible farming techniques on their land and want clarity on what waterways are federally regulated
      </li>
      <li>
        These comments opposed the proposed "dirty water" rule by making scientific arguments, sometimes noting the environmental threats like pollution, increased flood risk, and health and safety issues when regulations are loosened and the additional cost of clean-ups. They request the EPA abandon the dangerous rollback of the CWA and focus on protecting waterways
      </li>
      <li>
        This topic includes environmental arguments about the importance of headwater, the risk to downstream users when there's water issues, and that the EPA needs to continuously protect water using available science. It also notes that future generations will need to deal with any repercussions of the rule change
      </li>
      <li>
        This topic says clean water is a right and necessity in life, we all need it to live, and the government and its bureaucrats are responsible for protecting it for its citizens. It also notes the proposed rule undermines the CWA and doesn't establish a universal definition of federally protected waterways. Finally, it mentions the need to look to the future to see what we're leaving to our children
      </li>
      <li>
        This topic covers arguments that the rule change will diminish outdoor recreation experiences and can affect parks, nature, wildlife, coastal waters, and the health of communities. The comments note flourishing outdoor economies that are supported by clean waterways
      </li>
      <li>
        Commenters saying "we need to do more, not less to protect clean water" and that the CWA is a "bedrock environmental law". They make arguments to protect temporary waterways and ephemeral streams, with mentions of Western states, and that the new rule will leave these waterways unprotected. It warns against polluting industries and that the rule change puts profits ahead of the environment
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2>Finding Similar Comments via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization</h2>
  <p>
    An eight-topic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model was fit to the training data. The topics closely matched the ones the LDA model found, but the goal for this model was to calculate cosine similarity on normalized comment vectors in order to find similar comments. This could then be applied to perform either batch-labeling (find the similar comments to a known, labeled one), or to find similar comments to an unseen, new one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cosine similarity is a simple application of a math concept to test how similar comments (or any documents) are to each other. The training data term-frequency matrix rows represent a vector for each comment, where the values in the vector align with how many times certain vocabulary words show up in that comment. Comments with similar vocabulary will have similar vectors, and will therefore point in similar directions in hyperspace.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>cosine</code> of the angle created between any two comment vectors can indicate how similar their vocabulary is - the smaller the angle between the vectors, the higher the value of the <code>cosine(angle)</code> is (recall that <code>cosine(0) = 1</code>, which is the upper bound of the function's range). Therefore, cosine values near one indicate similarity. Likewise, as the language between comments diverges, that angle becomes larger, and the cosine value moves closer to zero. Because NMF doesn't allow for negative values, the resulting <code>cosine</code> values never go below zero.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two labeled comments (one supportive and one opposing) were randomly selected from the test set and run through the NMF pipeline. The tables below show the most similar comments in the training set as well as the <code>cosine</code> value between the test comment and those training comments. Note that personally identifying information about the commenter (such as their address) was removed from some comments.
  </p>

It provides for a more clear, specific, and limited description of what land is subject to regulation. I own 150 acres of farm ground. If I had to   hire engineering firms to determine whether of not permits were required to farm, I would not make enough income through renting or farming the land to recoup the cost. The proposed clean water rule will make it more practical for farmers themselves to understand and follow. I strongly support the proposed rule.</td>

  <h3>Similar Training Comments vs. an Example Opposing Comment</h3>

  <blockquote>
    "I am urging the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers to adopt the 2015 Clean Water Rule and abandon the revised WOTUS rule. The Clean Water Rule needs to protect ephemeral waters and wetlands, not limited to the "navigable waters" currently defined, since by nature water is ephemeral and is not contained in one area. Pollution in one area potentially pollutes unlimited areas. Not only is lack of protection a danger to human and animal health, it's also economically unfeasible, considering affects on drinking water. Additionally, loss of wetlands can take decades to restore."

          <td class="comment">We should be doing MORE to protect our waters, not less.  It is preposterous that you want to redefine "water" to remove protections from many wetlands and small streams. Please reconsider this unsound rule and keep the Clean Water Act in tact, in order to protect the health of Missouri communities and the waterways that we love and enjoy. The reasons the change should NOT take place: Wetlands are an important part of flood control so the new definition will increase flooding risk in Missouri. The new definition will threaten drinking water for over 2 million Missourians. The new definition ignores importance of wetlands and small streams for recreation. The new definition ignores public will for strengthened protections. Nearly 1.5 million American wrote in to support of the Clean Water Rule (currently in place) in 2014 and 2017. While the comment period for the original Clean Water Rule was open for over 200 days, we are concerned that the agency is only providing a 60-day comment period for the rollback of the Clean Water Rule now. I expect the administration and the EPA to protect our clean water, and I do NOT support efforts to weaken existing protections. My beloved state of Missouri is already woefully behind on implementing the Clean Water Act, and I'm concerned that the new "Waters" definition would take Missouri even further back.</td>

          <td class="comment">Clean water is vital to every living thing. It affects our ecology, our health, and our quality of life. Finalized in 2015, a Clean Water Rule within that act restored federal protections to half the nations streams, which help provide drinking water to one in every three Americans. This Rule also protects millions of acres of wetlands that provide wildlife habitat and keep pollutants out of Americas great waterways. The Rule is now under attack by the Trump administration through court suits and Executive Orders. The latest threat is a proposed narrowing of the definition of 'Waters of the United States' that would reduce by half the waters being regulated by the EPA concerning such matters as point source discharges; dredge and fill permits, and oil spill prevention programs.  Clearly, we need more clean water, not less.  I strongly oppose the proposed redefinition of "Waters of the United States" because it greatly reduces the scope of the Clean Water Act to protect wetlands and ensure safe water for all Americans.</td>

          <td class="comment">Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler, The EPA's proposed water rule will drastically weaken Clean Water Act protections in New Mexico. As an arid state, over 90% of New Mexico's waters do not flow year round and are therefore at risk of losing protections under this proposal. Even our biggest river, the Rio Grande, runs dry in sections during the summer! Many iconic New Mexico Rivers, such as the Gila River, Santa Fe River, Rio Ruidoso, and the Rio Costilla are threatened. Hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans depend on ephemeral or intermittent streams (waters that flow for only part of the year) for drinking water. Consistent flow in our streams, wildlife habitat, recreational uses, and our agricultural traditions are all dependent on the water that flows from our headwater wetlands, many of which will be left unprotected if this rule is passed. Please abandon this unwise rule that will hurt our water and our communities.</td>

          <td class="comment">I am writing to oppose President Trump's new water rule. This rule will impact clean water where people live, work, and play. The proposed rule would eliminate entire categories of waterways from the protections afforded by the Clean Water Act, threatening the water you use to drink, grow your food, fish, and recreate. Categories of excluded waterways include: interstate waters, ephemeral streams or other isolated waters, non-adjacent wetlands, ditches, upland waters, and groundwater. Please oppose this destructive water rule.</td>

          <td class="comment">To Whom It May Concern, The Friends of Tennant Lake and Hovander Park, an all-volunteer group, is concerned about the proposal to revise the definition of the Waters of the U.S. and no longer follow the guidance of the Clean Water Rule of 2015. For decades, the Clean Water Act, passed in 1972, has been essential to protecting the Waters of the United States from pollution and degradation. These waters encompass more than navigable rivers and lakes. We believe Congress clearly intended the protection of drinking water, agricultural water and ecosystems, including groundwater and the ephemeral streams that feed into our shared waterways. Tennant Lake and Tennant Creek adjoin the Nooksack River in northwest Washington State. We have seen the vital role the Nooksack plays in protecting and nurturing our precious salmon. Weve also witnessed the flood protection the Tennant Lake wetland provides to the farmers and residents of Whatcom County where we live: In full flood, the River flows up Tennant Creek into Tennant Lake, refilling the wetland, which serves as a nursery for wildlife and waterfowl. Our group and other residents use these natural cycles to illustrate the benefits of Tennant Lake and other wetlands. Our lake  also used for hunting and fishing  serves as a teaching habitat and beloved local recreational site. Our groups worry is that Tennant Lake and Tennant Creek  significant waters adjoining the Nooksack River - could lose the physical, chemical and biological protections currently afforded to wetlands, ground water and creeks by the Clean Water Rule of 2015 if that rule is suspended. Nearby Ferndale continues to expand towards Tennant Lake, and we rely on Clean Water Act protection to preserve the lake and its environs from pollution associated with careless development. Therefore, we ask that the U.S. EPA withdraw the Revised Definition of the Waters of the U.S. and allow the Clean Water Rule of 2015 to proceed.</td>
