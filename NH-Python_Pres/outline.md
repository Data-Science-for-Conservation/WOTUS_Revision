# A Survey of Natural Language Processing Techniques in Python

- Overview of project
- What is Machine Learning, how to do it in Python
- Why text is important, what is NLP, how to handle in ML
- How to convert text to machine-friendly format (3 count/freq-based methods, 1 slightly more sophisticated one that takes language semantics into account)
- Four different ML tasks performed on comment dataset

## What is Machine Learning?

 - What is Machine Learning?
     - At its essence, ML is model building, which is an attempt to make a simple representation of a real-world system, set of relationships, a process, etc. Examples: two particles colliding at high speeds, chemical reaction, 
     - It is also a great example of applied mathematics - the models use some combination of linear algebra, calculus, probabilistic logic from statistics, and even simple trigonometry
 - Differences compared to traditional model-buidling
     - Traditional model-building takes inputs, applies a set of rules or formulas to the inputs, and generates output
     - M&A finance example - plug company
     - Machine Learning flips this paradigm on its head: still have input, but instead of writing formulas or rules to calculate output, the model has a task to perform and it uses the examples you've fed it in your data to learn the relationships/patterns/trends
     - Being a bit vague here, because what the model outputs (solves for) depends on what the task is that it's trying to perform
 - How to use ML in Python
     - "Data Science Stack": SciPy, NumPy, Pandas
